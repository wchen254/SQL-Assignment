1. Describe the problem generics address.
Enable type to be a parameter to classes, methods, and interfaces, allow us to design classes and methdos but defer the specification of types until the class or method is declared and called
Check type safety. Reduce cade redundancy.

2. How would you create a list of strings, using the generic List class?
List<string> list = new List<string>();

3. How many generic type parameters does the Dictionary class have?
Dictionary<TKey,TValue> generic type has two type parameters, TKey and TValue , that represent the types of its keys and values.

4. True/False. When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they must all match. 
False, use <T>

5. What method is used to add items to a List object?
List.Add();

6. Name two methods that cause items to be removed from a List.
List.Remove();

7. How do you indicate that a class has a generic type parameter?
class ClassName<T>

8. True/False. Generic classes can only have one generic type parameter. 
False, <T,V>

9. True/False. Generic type constraints limit what can be used for the generic type. 
True

10. True/False. Constraints let you use the methods of the thing you are constraining to. 
True
