//1.Copying an Array
//Write code to create a copy of an array. First, start by creating an initial array. (You can use
//whatever type of data you want.) Let’s start with 10 items. Declare an array variable and
//assign it a new array with 10 items in it.Use the things we’ve discussed to put some values
//in the array.
//Now create a second array variable. Give it a new array with the same length as the first.
//Instead of using a number for this length, use the Lengthproperty to get the size of the
//original array.
//Use a loop to read values from the original array and place them in the new array.Also
//print out the contents of both arrays, to be sure everything copied correctly.
